Our project can be found in its entirety at https://github.com/acf62/Interaction-Design-25

To run: (These instructions are for windows)

Ensure that a java jdk of version 11 or higher is installed, and that the path to the java binary is in the PATH variable

Note: The window has quite a large minimum size, so make sure that your display is not zoomed in (this can be checked in display settings which can be accessed by right-clicking the desktop)

Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the project directory (same folder this file is in)

Run the following command:

java --module-path .\Library\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib\ --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar .\Interaction_Design_25.jar
