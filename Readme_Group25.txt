Our project can be found in its entirety at https://github.com/acf62/Interaction-Design-25

To run:
Unzip this project and open it in IntelliJ. Ensure that you have javafx installed and a recent JDK (works fine on JDK 8). Run scr/uk/ac/cam/interactiondesign25/main/Main. This should work.

Our apologies for the late submission and sub-par method of running- we have had significant technical difficulties with making a .jar file.
